#Stock Year Market Data

This VBA will create a script that loops through all the stocks for three years and outputs the following information:

* The ticker symbol
* Yearly change from the opening price at the beginning of a given year to the closing price at the end of that year.
* The percentage change from the opening price at the beginning of a given year to the closing price at the end of that year.
* The total stock volume of the stock. The result should match the following image:

It would also calculate the following:
* Greatest % increase 
* Greatest % decrease
* Greatest total volume

The entire VBA script would be enabled so that it can run on every worksheet (that is, every year) at once.
